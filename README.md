Logan is a useless demo application that allows you to log your activities
throughout the day.  Kind of like a personal twitter.  It doesn't support users
or any of the session management shebang.

It is meant to help out in showing the ease with which web-applications can be
created using django,python,html,css and accompanying technologies.

# Setting up 

```sh
git clone http://github.com/schatten/logan.git
cd logan

! edit the first line in localsettings.py to reflect the current directory

python manage.py runserver
```
